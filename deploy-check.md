# Deployment Check - Static Site Configuration

## Issue Identified
Your Render deployment was running `npm run build && npm start` instead of just the build command. This happened because:
1. Your `package.json` had a `start` script
2. Render detected this and tried to run both build and start commands
3. For static sites, only the build command should run

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Start Script
- Removed `"start": "node server.js"` from `package.json`
- This prevents Render from trying to run a server

### 2. Updated Render Configuration
- Added `autoDeploy: true` to `render.yaml`
- Ensured proper static site configuration

## Current Configuration

### package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "vite",
    "build": "vite build",
    "preview": "vite preview"
  }
}
```

### render.yaml
```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: skygemai
    env: static
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    staticPublishPath: ./dist
    autoDeploy: true
```

## Expected Build Output
After successful deployment, Render should show:
```
==> Running build command 'npm install && npm run build'...
> skynetai@0.0.0 build
> vite build

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Render deployment: remove start script for static site"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Verify Render Settings:**
   - Go to your Render dashboard
   - Ensure the service type is "Static Site"
   - Build Command should be: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish Directory should be: `dist`

3. **After redeploy, check:**
   - ✅ No "npm start" in build logs
   - ✅ Only build command runs
   - ✅ Application loads correctly
   - ✅ No MIME type errors

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Running npm start
- Check that you've pushed the updated `package.json`
- Verify Render service type is "Static Site"
- Check build logs for correct command

### If Build Fails
- Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
- Check for any TypeScript errors
- Verify Vite configuration is correct

## Success Indicators
- ✅ Build command only runs (no start command)
- ✅ Files served from `dist` folder
- ✅ No server running (static files only)
- ✅ Application loads with proper styling
