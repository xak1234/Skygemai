# Deployment Guide - Fixing MIME Type Issues

## Problem
Your application was experiencing MIME type errors because:
1. The server was serving raw source files (`index.css`, `index.tsx`) instead of built files
2. Tailwind CDN was being used in production (not recommended)
3. Missing proper build configuration

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed HTML Structure
- Removed Tailwind CDN from `index.html`
- Removed direct CSS link (Vite will handle this)
- Removed importmap (not needed for production)

### 2. Proper CSS Import
- Added `import './index.css'` to `index.tsx`
- Created comprehensive `index.css` with all utility classes
- Vite will now bundle and hash the CSS file

### 3. Build Configuration
- Updated `vite.config.ts` with proper build settings
- Added CSS sourcemap support for development
- Configured asset file naming with hashes

### 4. Deployment Options

#### Option A: Render (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect to Render
3. Use these settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
   - **Publish Directory**: `dist`
   - **Environment**: Static Site

#### Option B: Express Server
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Start: `npm start`
3. Server will serve files with proper MIME types

#### Option C: Docker
1. Build: `docker build -t skygemai .`
2. Run: `docker run -p 80:80 skygemai`

## Verification

After deployment, your application should:
- ✅ Load without MIME type errors
- ✅ Have all styles applied correctly
- ✅ Serve built files (not source files)
- ✅ Have proper Content-Type headers

## Files Changed
- `index.html` - Removed CDN and direct file references
- `index.tsx` - Added CSS import
- `index.css` - Created comprehensive styles
- `vite.config.ts` - Enhanced build configuration
- `render.yaml` - Updated deployment config
- `package.json` - Added missing dependencies

## Testing Locally
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The build should create a `dist` folder with:
- `index.html` (processed by Vite)
- `assets/index-[hash].css` (bundled CSS)
- `assets/index-[hash].js` (bundled JavaScript)
