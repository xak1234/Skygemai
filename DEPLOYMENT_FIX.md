# Deployment Fix for MIME Type Issue

## Problem
The application was showing the error:
```
Loading module from "https://skygemai.onrender.com/main.tsx" was blocked because of a disallowed MIME type ("binary/octet-stream").
```

## Root Cause
The server was trying to serve TypeScript files directly instead of the compiled JavaScript files, and the MIME type handling was incomplete.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Server Configuration (`server.js`)
- Added proper MIME type handling for `.mjs` files
- Added MIME type handling for `.html` files
- Improved error handling for missing build files
- Added debugging logs to show available files

### 2. Updated Render Configuration (`render.yaml`)
- Added MIME type headers for `.mjs` files
- Added MIME type headers for `.html` files
- Ensured all JavaScript files are served with correct content type

### 3. Verified Build Process
- Confirmed that `npm run build` creates proper compiled files
- Verified that `dist/index.html` correctly references compiled assets
- Tested local server to ensure proper MIME type serving

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push the changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix MIME type issues for JavaScript files"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Trigger deployment on Render:**
   - The deployment should start automatically due to auto-deploy being enabled
   - Monitor the build logs to ensure the build completes successfully

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Check that the application loads without MIME type errors
   - Verify that JavaScript files are served with `application/javascript` content type
   - Test the application functionality

## Files Modified
- `server.js` - Updated MIME type handling and error checking
- `render.yaml` - Added proper content type headers
- `deploy-verify.sh` - Updated verification script

## Testing
The local server has been tested and confirmed to serve files with correct MIME types:
- ✅ JavaScript files served with `application/javascript`
- ✅ CSS files served with `text/css`
- ✅ HTML files served with `text/html`

## Expected Result
After deployment, the application should load without MIME type errors and function correctly.
