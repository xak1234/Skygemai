# Deployment Fix for Skygemai

## Issue Fixed
The application was failing to load because it was trying to serve `index.tsx` directly instead of the built JavaScript files. This caused a MIME type error.

## Changes Made

### 1. Entry Point Fix
- Created `main.tsx` as the proper entry point
- Updated `index.html` to reference `/main.tsx` instead of `/index.tsx`
- Removed the old `index.tsx` file

### 2. Build Configuration
- Updated `vite.config.ts` to include proper build settings
- Added `base: '/'` and `outDir: 'dist'` configurations
- Ensured proper asset handling

### 3. Server Configuration
- Updated `server.js` to properly serve static files from the `dist` directory
- Improved MIME type handling
- Added proper SPA routing

### 4. Package Configuration
- Added `start` script to `package.json` for production deployment
- Updated `render.yaml` to use Node.js environment instead of static hosting

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure to set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:
- `GROK_API_KEY` - Your Grok API key
- `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` - Your DeepSeek API key
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Gemini API key (optional)

### 2. Build Process
The application will now:
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Build the application with `npm run build`
3. Start the server with `npm start`

### 3. File Structure
After build, the structure should be:
```
dist/
├── index.html
├── assets/
│   ├── main-[hash].js
│   └── index-[hash].css
```

## Testing Locally
1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000`

The application should now load properly without MIME type errors.
