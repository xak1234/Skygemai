# Redeployment Guide - Fixing Current Issues

## Current Problems
Your deployment is experiencing these issues:
1. ❌ Still loading Tailwind CDN (should be removed)
2. ❌ Serving raw source files (`index.css`, `index.tsx`) instead of built files
3. ❌ MIME type errors for CSS and JS files
4. ❌ Missing proper Content-Type headers

## Root Cause
The deployment is serving the source files directly instead of the built application from the `dist` folder.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Verify Local Build
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Check that `dist/index.html` contains:
```html
<script type="module" crossorigin src="/assets/index-[hash].js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" crossorigin href="/assets/index-[hash].css">
```

### 2. Force Redeploy on Render

#### Option A: Manual Redeploy
1. Go to your Render dashboard
2. Find your `skygemai` service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
4. Wait for build to complete

#### Option B: Push New Commit
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment: remove CDN, use built files"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify Deployment Settings
Ensure your Render service has:
- **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Environment**: Static Site

### 4. Check Deployment Logs
After redeploy, check the build logs to ensure:
- ✅ `npm install` completed successfully
- ✅ `npm run build` completed successfully
- ✅ Files are being served from `dist` folder

### 5. Test the Deployment
After redeploy, your application should:
- ✅ Load without Tailwind CDN errors
- ✅ Serve built CSS and JS files with proper MIME types
- ✅ Have all input boxes with white/green text on dark backgrounds
- ✅ No MIME type errors in browser console

## Expected File Structure After Build
```
dist/
├── index.html (processed by Vite)
├── assets/
│   ├── index-[hash].css (bundled CSS)
│   └── index-[hash].js (bundled JS)
└── _redirects (if using Netlify)
```

## Troubleshooting

### If Still Getting CDN Errors
- Check that your `index.html` doesn't have Tailwind CDN script
- Ensure the built `dist/index.html` is being served

### If Still Getting MIME Type Errors
- Verify Render is serving files from `dist` folder
- Check that `render.yaml` has correct MIME type headers
- Ensure build completed successfully

### If Build Fails
- Check that all dependencies are installed
- Verify `package.json` has correct scripts
- Check for any TypeScript errors

## Success Indicators
After successful redeploy:
- ✅ No Tailwind CDN errors
- ✅ No MIME type errors
- ✅ Application loads with proper styling
- ✅ All input boxes have proper contrast
- ✅ Console shows no errors
